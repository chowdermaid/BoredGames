Week 1
  - Created Jira Board. Chose the ecommerce topic. Discussed with team our strengths, weaknesses and what we can contribute to the team.
  - Given I had abit of jira experience from past work experience, I set up the jira. We discussed different novelty functionalities for the ecommerce website.
  - Settled on Gifting and a Gacha roll after purchasing. (To get customers to keep coming back).
  - We delegated the user stories to the team and finished them all by next week
  - I also modified some of the priorities and added user story points where necessary.
Week 2
  - We planned to finish 90% of the proposal by next tutorial. After the tutorial I created the storyboard for login and the home screen.
  - We then found out that the Rachid the lecturer rejected our Harry Potter custom wand idea on Thursday. 
  - This set our team back and the existing work I did with the Harry Potter Scheme.
  - Dom was very helpful in clarifying what was necessary as a theme.
  - We couldn't come up with a idea that we all agreed on until Sunday.
  - We decided to then pick a board games ecommerce website (and called it Bored Games cos its punny).
  - All of sunday I spent time rereating the colour scheme/logo and created the storyboard for user browsing, login, payment screens, secret santa.
  - Cleaned up the tickets.
Week 3
  - During the tutorial, we also asked Dom on how to present the storyboards in the proposal. I separated, the my selected story boards into separate functionalities.
  - We managed to complete I'd say 85% of the proposal. All that was left was finalising the proposal (editing) and system architecture.
  - On Sunday we finalised everything, submitted the proposal and even added an extra functionality (My Board Game Collections)
